# Smart Contract Training
Ethereum, Solidity and Smart Contract company code and research material to help train the next generation of Blockchain Engineers.

Deploy the contracts
===
In order to deploy a contract, open the file, copy its contents and paste into Remix, then go compile and deploy into the network.
I recommend using the internal ledger (Remix VM) to learn and execute these contracts, but you can also use the testnet (Sepolia)

## Contract 1 (ETHUSD-Feed) (no division)
0x78aA35ac1CE4D1F0e82a278437E87840B6b15743

## Contract 2 (ETHUSD-Feed2) (with division)
0x8F883835A428fF793d664c34C2721AEA6cB78b7F
